    <p>
      I am a bachelor uncle. That, as a mere fact, might happen to anybody; but
      I am a bachelor uncle by internal fitness. I am one essentially, just as I
      am an individual of the Caucasian division of the human race; and if,
      through untoward circumstances&mdash;which Heaven forbid&mdash;I should
      lose my present position, I shouldn't be surprised if you saw me out in
      the &ldquo;Herald&rdquo; under &ldquo;Situations Wanted&mdash;Males.&rdquo; Thanks to a marrying
      tendency in the rest of my family, I have now little need to advertise,
      all the business being thrown into my way which a single member of my
      profession can attend to. I suppose you won't agree with me; but, do you
      know, sometimes I think it's better than having children of one's own?
      People tell me that I'd feel very differently if I did have any. Perhaps
      so, but then, too, I might be unwise with them; I might bother them into
      mischief by trying to keep them out. I might be avaricious of them&mdash;might
      be tempted to lock them up in my own stingy old nursery-chest instead of
      paying them out to meet the bills of humanity and keep the Lord's business
      moving. I might forget, when I had spent my life in fining their gold and
      polishing their graven-work, that they were still vessels for the Master's
      use&mdash;I only the Butler&mdash;the sweetness and the spirit with which
      they brimmed all belonging to His lips who tasted bitterness for me. Then,
      if seeking to drain another's wine, I raised the chalice to my lips and
      found it gall, or felt it steal into my old veins to poison the heart and
      paralyze the hand which had kept it from the Master, what further good
      would there be for me in the world? Who doesn't know, in some friend's
      house, a closet containing that worst of skeletons&mdash;the skeleton
      which, in becoming naked, grim and ghastly, tears its way through our own
      flesh and blood? To be an uncle is a different kind of thing. There you
      have nothing of the excitement of responsibility to shake your judgment
      That's what makes us bachelor uncles so much better judges of what's good
      for children and their fathers and mothers. We know that nobody will blame
      us if our nephews unjoint their knuckles or cut their fingers off; so we
      give them five-bladed knives and boxing gloves. This involves getting
      thanked at the time, which is pleasant; and if no catastrophe occurs, when
      they have grown stout and ingenious, with what calm satisfaction we hear
      people say, &ldquo;See what a pretty windmill the child's whittled out with
      Uncle Ned's birthday present!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;That boy's grown an inch round the
      chest since you set him sparring!&rdquo; Uncles never get stale. They don't come
      every day like parents and plain pudding; they're a sort of holiday
      relative with a plummy, Christmas flavor about them. Everybody hasn't got
      them; they are not so rare as the meteoric showers, but as occasional as a
      particularly fine day, and whenever they come to a house they're in the
      nature of a pleasant surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      I meander, like a desultory, placid river of an old bachelor as I am,
      through the flowery mead of several nurseries. I am detained by all the
      little roots that run down into me to drink happiness, but I linger
      longest among the children of my sister Lu.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lu married Mr. Lovegrove. He is a merchant, retired, with a fortune
      amassed by the old-fashioned slow process of trade, and regards the
      mercantile life of the present day only as so much greed and gambling
      Christianly baptized. For the ten years elapsing since he sold out of
      Lovegrove, Cashdown &amp; Co., he has devoted himself to his family and a
      revival of letters, taking up again the Latin and Greek which he had not
      looked at since his college days, until he dismissed teas and silks to
      adorn a suburban villa with a spectacle of a prime Christian parent and
      Pagan scholar. Lu is my favorite sister; Lovegrove an unusually good
      article of brother-in-law; and I can not say that any of my nieces and
      nephews interest me more than their two children, Daniel and Billy, who
      are more unlike than words can paint them. They are far apart in point of
      years; Daniel is twenty-two, Billy eleven. I was reminded of this fact the
      other day by Billy, as he stood between my legs, scowling at his book of
      sums.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'A boy has 85 turnips and gives his sister 80'&mdash;pretty present for a
      girl, isn't it?&rdquo; said Billy with an air of supreme contempt. &ldquo;Could <i>you</i>
      stand such stuff&mdash;say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I put on my instructive face and answered: &ldquo;Well, my dear Billy, you know
      that arithmetic is necessary to you if you mean to be an industrious man
      and succeed in business. Suppose your parents were to lose all their
      property, what would become of them without a little son who could make
      money and keep accounts?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Billy with surprise. &ldquo;Hasn't father got enough stamps to see
      him through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has now, I hope; but people don't always keep them. Suppose they
      should go by some accident when your father was too old to make any more
      stamps for himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You haven't thought of brother Daniel&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      True; for nobody ever had, in connection with the active employments of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Billy,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;I forgot him; but then, you know, Daniel is more
      of a student than a business man, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Teddy! you don't think I meant he'd support them? I meant I'd
      have to take care of father and mother and of all when they'd all got to
      be old people together. Just think! I'm eleven and he's twenty-two; so he
      is just twice as old as I am. How old are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forty, Billy, last August.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you aren't so awful old, and when I get to be as old as you Daniel
      will be eighty. Seth Kendall's grandfather isn't more than that, and he
      has to be fed with a spoon, and a nurse puts him to bed and wheels him
      around in a chair like a baby. That takes the stamps, <i>I</i> bet! Well,
      I'll tell you how I'll keep my accounts; I'll have a stick like Robinson
      Crusoe, and every time I make a toadskin I'll gouge a piece out of one
      side of the stick, and every time I spend one I'll gouge a piece out of
      the other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Spend a what!&rdquo; said the gentle and astonished voice of my sister Lu, who,
      unperceived, had slipped into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A toadskin, ma,&rdquo; replied Billy, shutting up Colburn with a farewell
      glance of contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear! dear! where does the boy learn such horrid words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, ma! don't you know what a toadskin is? Here's one,&rdquo; said Billy,
      drawing a dingy five-cent stamp from his pocket. &ldquo;And don't I wish I had
      lots of 'em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; sighed his mother, &ldquo;to think I should have a child so addicted to
      slang! How I wish he were like Daniel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother,&rdquo; replied Billy, &ldquo;if you wanted two boys just alike you'd
      oughter had twins. There ain't any use of my trying to be like Daniel now
      when he's got eleven years the start. Whoop! There's a dog-fight! Hear
      'em! It's Joe Casey's dog&mdash;I know his bark!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words my nephew snatched his Glengarry bonnet from the table
      and bolted downstairs to see the fun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will become of him?&rdquo; said Lu hopelessly; &ldquo;he has no taste for
      anything but rough play; and then such language as he uses! Why <i>isn't</i>
      he like Daniel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose because his Maker never repeats himself. Even twins often
      possess strongly marked individualities. Don't you think it would be a
      good plan to learn Billy better before you try to teach him? If you do
      you'll make something as good of him as Daniel; though it will be rather
      different from that model.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember, Ned, that you never did like Daniel as well as you do Billy.
      But we all know the proverb about old maids' daughters and old bachelors'
      sons. I wish you had Billy for a month&mdash;then you'd see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure that I'd do any better than you. I might err as much in
      other directions. But I'd try to start right by acknowledging that he was
      a new problem, not to be worked without finding the value of 'x' in his
      particular instance. The formula which solves one boy will no more solve
      the next one than the rule of three will solve a question in calculus&mdash;or,
      to rise into your sphere, than the receipt for one-two-three-four cake
      conduct you to a successful issue through plum pudding&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I excel in metaphysical discussions, and was about giving further
      elaboration of my favorite idea when the door burst open. Master Billy
      came tumbling in with a torn jacket, a bloody nose, the trace of a few
      tears in his eyes, and the mangiest of cur dogs in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh my! my!! my!!!&rdquo; exclaimed his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you get scared, ma!&rdquo; cried Billy, smiling a stern smile of triumph;
      &ldquo;I smashed the nose off him! He won't sass me again for nothing <i>this</i>
      while! Uncle Teddy, d'ye know it wasn't a dogfight after all? There was
      that nasty good-for-nothing Joe Casey 'n' Patsy Grogan and a lot of bad
      boys from Mackerelville; and they'd caught this poor little ki-oodle and
      tied a tin pot to his tail and were trying to set Joe's dog on him, though
      he's ten times littler&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You naughty, naughty boy! How did you suppose your mother'd feel to see
      you playing with those ragamuffins?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I <i>played</i> 'em! I polished 'em&mdash;that's the play I did!
      Says I, 'Put down that poor little pup! Ain't you ashamed of yourself,
      Patsy Grogan?' 'I guess you don't know who I am,' says he. That's the way
      they always say, Uncle Teddy, to make a fellow think they're some awful
      great fighters. So says I again, 'Well, you put down that dog or I'll show
      you who <i>I</i> am'; and when he held on, I let him have it. Then he
      dropped the pup, and as I stooped to pick it up he gave me one on the
      bugle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Bugle!</i> Oh! oh! oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The rest pitched in to help him; but I grabbed the pup, and while I was
      trying to give as good as I got&mdash;only a fellow can't do it well with
      only one hand, Uncle Teddy&mdash;up came a policeman and the whole crowd
      ran away. So I got the dog safe, and here he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With that Billy set down his &ldquo;ki-oodle,&rdquo; bade farewell to every fear, and
      wiped his bleeding nose. The unhappy beast slunk back between the legs of
      his preserver and followed him out of the room, as Lu, with an expression
      of maternal despair, bore him away for the correction of his dilapidated
      raiment and depraved associations. I felt such sincere pride in this young
      Mazzini of the dog-nation that I was vexed at Lu for bestowing on him
      reproof instead of congratulation; but she was not the only conservative
      who fails to see a good cause and a heroic heart under a bloody nose and
      torn jacket. I resolved that if Billy was punished, he should have his
      recompense before long in an extra holiday at Barnum's or the
      Hippotheatron.
    </p>
    <p>
      You already have some idea of my other nephew if you have noticed that
      none of us, not even that habitual disrespecter of dignities, Billy, ever
      called him Dan. It would have seemed as incongruous as to call Billy
      William.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of those youths who never give their parents a moment's
      uneasiness; who never have to have their wills broken, and never forget to
      put on their rubbers or take an umbrella. In boyhood he was intended for a
      missionary. Had it been possible for him to go to Greenland's icy
      mountains without catching cold, or to India's coral strand without
      getting bilious, his parents would have carried out their pleasing dream
      of contributing him to the world's evangelization. Lu and Mr. Lovegrove
      had no doubt that he would have been greatly blessed if he could have
      stood it. They brought him up in the most careful manner, and I can not
      recollect the time when he was not president, secretary, or something in
      some society of small yet good children. He was not only an exemplar to
      whom all Lu's friends pointed their own nursery as the little boy who
      could say most hymns and sit stillest in church, but he was a reproof even
      unto his elders. One Sunday afternoon, in the Connecticut village where my
      brother-in-law used to spend his summers, when half of the congregation
      was slumbering under the combined effect of the heat, a lunch of cheese
      and apples, and the sermon, my nephew, then aged five, sat bolt upright in
      the pew, winkless as a demon hearing a new candidate suspected of
      shakiness on a &ldquo;a card'nal p'int,&rdquo; and mortified almost to death poor old
      Mrs. Pringle, who, compassionating his years, had handed him a sprig of
      her &ldquo;meetin'-seed&rdquo; over the back of the seat, by saying, in a loud and
      stern voice: &ldquo;I don't eat things in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I should have spanked the boy when I got home, but Lu, with tears in her
      eyes, quoted something about the mouths of babes and sucklings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both she and his father always encouraged old manners in him. I think they
      took such pride in raising a peculiarly pale boy as a gardener does in
      getting a nice blanch on his celery, and, so long as he was not absolutely
      sick, the graver he was, the better. He was a sensitive plant, a violet by
      a mossy stone, and all that sort of thing. But when in his tenth year he
      had the measles, and was narrowly carried through, Lu got a scare about
      him. During his convalescence, reading aloud a life of Henry Martyn to
      amuse him, she found in it a picture of that young apostle preaching to a
      crowd of Hindus without any boots on. An American mother's association of
      such behavior with croup and ipecac was too strong to be counteracted by
      known climatic facts; and from that hour, as she never had before, Lu
      realized that being a missionary might involve going to carry the gospel
      to the heathen in your stocking-feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had decided that such a life would not do for him, his training
      had almost entirely unfitted him for any other active calling. The strict
      propriety with which he had been brought up had resulted in weak lungs,
      poor digestion, sluggish circulation, and torpid liver. Moreover, he was
      troubled with the painfulest bashfulness which ever made a mother think
      her child too ethereal, or a dispassionate outsider regard him as too
      flimsy, for this world. These were weights enough to carry, even if he had
      not labored under that heaviest of all, a well-stored mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      No misnomer that last to any one who has ever frequented the Atlantic
      Docks, or seen storage in any large port of entry. How does a storehouse
      look? It's a vast, dark, cold chamber-dust an inch deep on the floor,
      cobwebs festooning the girders&mdash;and piled from floor to ceiling on
      the principle of getting the largest bulk into the least room, with
      barrels, boxes, bales, baskets, chests, crates, and carboys&mdash;merchandise
      of all description, from the rough, raw material to the most exquisite <i>choses
      de luxe</i>. The inmost layers are inextricable without pulling down the
      outer ones. If you want a particular case of broadcloth you must clear
      yourself an alleyway through a hundred tierces of hams, and last week's
      entry of clayed sugars is inaccessible without tumbling on your head a
      mountain of Yankee notions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my nephew's unfortunate youth such storage as this had minds. As long
      as the crown of his brain's arch was not crushed in by some intellectual
      Furman Street diaster, those stevedores of learning, the schoolmasters,
      kept on unloading the Rome and Athens lighters into a boy's crowded skull,
      and breaking out of the hold of that colossal old junk, The Pure
      Mathematics, all the formulas which could be crowded into the interstices
      between his Latin and Greek. At the time I introduce Billy, both Lu and
      her husband were much changed. They had gained a great deal in width of
      view and liberality of judgment. They read Dickens and Thackeray with
      avidity; went now and then to the opera; proposed to let Billy take a
      quarter at Dod-worth's; had statues in their parlor without any thought of
      shame at their lack of petticoats, and did multitudes of things which, in
      their early married life, they would have considered shocking. Part of
      this change was due to the great increase of travel, the wonderful
      progress in art and refinement which has enlarged this generation's
      thought and corrected its ignorant opinions; infusing cosmopolitanism into
      our manners by a revolution so gradual that its subjects were a new people
      before their combativeness became alarmed, yet so rapid that a man of
      thirty can scarcely believe his birthday, and questions whether he has not
      added his life up wrong by a century or so when he compares his own
      boy-Hood with that of the present day. But a good deal of the
      transformation resulted from the means of gratifying elegant tastes, the
      comfort, luxury, and culture which came with Lovegrove's retirement on a
      fortune. They had mellowed on the sunny shelves of prosperity, like every
      good thing which has an astringent skin when it is green. They would
      greatly have liked to see Daniel shine in society. Of his erudition they
      were proud, even to worship. The young man never had any business, and his
      father never seemed to think of giving him any; knowing, as Billy would
      say, that he had stamps enough to &ldquo;see him through.&rdquo; If Daniel liked, his
      father would have endowed a professorship in some college and have given
      him the chair; but that would have taken him away from his own room and
      the family physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel knew how much his parents wished him to make a figure in the world,
      and only blamed himself for his failure, magnanimously forgetting that
      they had crushed out the faculties which enable a man to mint the small
      change of everyday society in the exclusive cultivation of such as fit him
      for smelting its ponderous ingots. With that merciful blindness which
      alone prevents all our lives from becoming a horror of nerveless reproach,
      his parents were equally unaware of their share in the harm done him, when
      they ascribed to his delicate organization the fact that, at an age when
      love runs riot in all healthy blood, he could not see a balmoral without
      his cheeks rivaling the most vivid stripe in it. They flattered themselves
      that he would outgrow his bashfulness, but Daniel had no such hope, and
      frequently confided in me that he thought he should never marry at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two hours after Billy's disappearance under his mother's convoy, the
      defender of the oppressed returned to my room bearing the dog under his
      arm. His cheeks shone with washing like a pair of waxy Spitzenbergs, and
      other indignities had been offered him to the extent of the brush and
      comb. He also had a whole jacket on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Billy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what are you going to do with your dog?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what I'm going to do. I've a great mind to be a bad,
      disobedient boy with him, and <i>not</i> have my days long in the land
      which the Lord my God giveth me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't help it. They won't be long if I don't mind ma, she says; and she
      wants me to be mean, and put Crab out in the street to have Patsy catch
      him and tie coffee-pots to his tail. I&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here my small nephew dug his fist into his eye and looked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told Billy to stop where he was, and went to intercede with Lu. She was
      persuaded to entertain the angels of magnanimity and heroism in the
      disguise of a young fighting character, and to accept my surety for the
      behavior of his dog. Billy and I also obtained permission to go out
      together and be gone the entire afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      We put Crab on a comfortable bed of rags in an old shoe box, and then
      strolled, hand-in-hand, across that most delightful of New York
      breathing-places, Stuyvesant Square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Teddy!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy with ardor; &ldquo;I wish I could do something to
      show you how much I think of you for being so good to me. I don't know
      how. Would it make you happy if I was to learn a hymn for you&mdash;a
      smashing big hymn&mdash;six verses, long metre, and no grumbling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Billy; you make me happy enough just by being a good boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Uncle Teddy!&rdquo; replied Billy decidedly, &ldquo;I'm afraid I can't do it.
      I've tried so often and I always make such an awful mess of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you get discouraged too easily&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if a savings-bank won't do it, there ain't any chance for a boy. I
      got father to get me a savings-bank once and began being good just as hard
      as ever I could for three cents a day. Every night I got 'em, I put 'em in
      reg'lar, and sometimes I'd keep being good three whole days running. That
      made a sight of money, I tell you. Then I'd do something, ma said, to kick
      my pail of milk over, and those nights I didn't get anything. I used to
      put in most of my marble and candy money, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you going to do with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was for an Objeck, Uncle Teddy. That's a kind of Indian, you know,
      that eats people and wants the gospel. That's what pa says, anyway; I
      didn't ever see one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn't that make you happy&mdash;to help the poor little heathen
      children?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, does it, Uncle Teddy? They never got a cent of it. One time I was
      good so long I got scared. I was afraid I'd never want to fly my kite on a
      roof again or go anywhere where I oughtn't, or have any fun. I couldn't
      see any use of going and saving my money to send out to the Objecks if it
      was going to make good boys of 'em. It was awful hard for me to have to be
      a good boy, and it must be worse for them 'cause they ain't used to it. So
      when there wasn't anybody upstairs I went and shook a lot of pennies out
      of my chimney and bought ever so much taffy and marbles and popcorn. Was
      that awful mean, Uncle Teddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question involved such complications that I hesitated. Before I could
      decide what to answer Billy continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma said it was robbing the heathen, and didn't I get it? I thought if it
      was robbing I'd have a cop after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's a 'cop'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what the boys call a policeman, Uncle Teddy; and then I should be
      taken away and put in an awful black place underground, like Johnny Wilson
      when he broke Mrs. Perkins's window. I was scared, I tell you. But I
      didn't get anything worse than a whipping, and having my savings bank
      taken away from me with all that was left in it, I haven't tried to be
      good since, much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      We now got into a Broadway stage going down, and being unable, on account
      of the noise, to converse further upon those spiritual conflicts of
      Billy's which so much interested me, we amused ourselves with looking out
      until just as we reached the Astor House, when he asked me where we were
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you guess?&rdquo; said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast a glance through the front window and his face became irradiated.
      Oh, there's nothing like the simple, cheap luxury of pleasing a child, to
      create sunshine enough for the chasing away of the bluest adult devils!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going to Barnum's,&rdquo; said Billy, involuntarily clapping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we were; and, much as stuck-up people pretend to look down at the
      place, I frequently am. Not only so, but I always see that class largely
      represented there when I do go. To be sure, they always make believe that
      they only come to amuse the children, or because their country cousins
      visit them; and never fail to refer to the vulgar set one finds there, and
      the fact of the animals smelling like anything but Jockey Club; yet I
      notice that after they've been in the hall three minutes they're as much
      interested as any of the people they come to poh-poh, and only put on the
      high-bred air when they fancy some of their own class are looking at them.
      I boldly acknowledge that I go because I like it. I am especially happy,
      to be sure, if I have a child along to go into ecstasies and give me a
      chance, by asking questions, for the exhibition of that fund of
      information which is said to be one of my chief charms in the social
      circle, and on several occasions has led that portion of the public
      immediately about the Happy Family into the erroneous impression that I
      was Mr. Barnum explaining his five hundred thousand curiosities. On the
      present occasion we found several visitors of the better class in the room
      devoted to the Aquarium. Among these was a young lady, apparently about
      nineteen, in a tight-fitting basque of black velvet, which showed her
      elegant figure to fine advantage, a skirt of garnet silk, looped up over a
      pretty Balmoral, and the daintiest imaginable pair of kid walking-boots.
      Her height was a trifle over the medium, her eyes, a soft expressive
      brown, shaded by masses of hair which exactly matched their color, and, at
      that rat-and-miceless day, fell in such graceful abandon as to show at
      once that nature was the only maid who crimped their waves into them. Her
      complexion was rosy with health and sympathetic enjoyment; her mouth was
      faultless, her nose sensitive, her manners full of refinement, and her
      voice musical as a wood-robin's, when she spoke to the little boy of six
      at her side, to whom she was revealing the palace of the great show-king.
      Billy and I were flattening our noses against the abode of the
      balloon-fish and determining whether he looked most like a horse-chestnut
      burr or a ripe cucumber, when his eyes and my own simultaneously fell on
      the child and lady. In a moment, to Billy the balloon-fish was as though
      he had not been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a pretty little boy!&rdquo; said I. And then I asked Billy one of those
      senseless routine questions which must make children look at us, regarding
      the scope of our intellects very much as we look at Bushmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How would you like to play with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him!&rdquo; replied Billy scornfully, &ldquo;that's his first pair of boots; see him
      pull up his little breeches to show the red tops to them! But, crackey!
      isn't <i>she</i> a smasher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After that we visited the wax figures and the sleepy snakes, the learned
      seal, and the glass-blowers. Whenever we passed from one room into
      another, Billy could be caught looking anxiously to see if the pretty girl
      and child were coming, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time fails me to describe how Billy was lost in the astonishment at the
      Lightning Calculator&mdash;wanted me to beg the secret of that prodigy for
      him to do his sums by&mdash;finally thought he had discovered it, and
      resolved to keep his arm whirling all the time he studied his arithmetic
      lesson the next morning. Equally inadequate is it to relate in full how he
      became so confused among the waxworks that he pinched the solemnest
      showman's legs to see if he was real, and perplexed the beautiful
      Circassian to the verge of idiocy by telling her he had read all about the
      way they sold girls like her in his geography.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had reached the stairs to that subterranean chamber in which the
      Behemoth of Holy Writ was wallowing about without a thought of the dignity
      which one expects from a canonical character. Billy had always languished
      upon his memories of this diverting beast, and I stood ready to see him
      plunge headlong the moment that he read the signboard at the head of the
      stairs. When he paused and hesitated there, not seeming at all anxious to
      go down till he saw the pretty girl and the child following after&mdash;a
      sudden intuition flashed across me. Could it be possible that Billy was
      caught in that vortex which whirled me down at ten years&mdash;a little
      boy's first love?
    </p>
    <p>
      We were lingering about the elliptical basin, and catching occasional
      glimpses between bubbles of a vivified hair trunk of monstrous compass,
      whose knobby lid opened at one end and showed a red morocco lining, when
      the pretty girl, in leaning over to point out the rising monster, dropped
      into the water one of her little gloves, and the swash made by the
      hippopotamus drifted it close under Billy's hand. Either in play, or as a
      mere coincidence, the animal followed it. The other children about the
      tank screamed and started back as he bumped his nose against the side; but
      Billy manfully bent down and grabbed the glove, not an inch from one of
      his big tusks, then marched around the tank and presented it to the lady
      with a chivalry of manner in one of his years quite surprising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a real nice boy&mdash;you said so, didn't you, Lottie? And I wish
      he'd come and play with me,&rdquo; said the little fellow by the young lady's
      side, as Billy turned away, gracefully thanked, to come back to me with
      his cheeks roseate with blushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he heard this, Billy sidled along the edge of the tank for a moment,
      then faced about and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P'rhaps I will some day&mdash;where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I live on East Seventeenth Street with papa&mdash;and Lottie stays there
      too now&mdash;she's my cousin: where d'you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I live close by&mdash;right on that big green square where I guess
      the nurse takes you once in a while,&rdquo; said Billy patronizingly. Then,
      looking up pluckily at the young lady, he added, &ldquo;I never saw you out
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jimmy's papa has only been in his new house a little while, and I've
      just come to visit him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, will you come and play with me some time?&rdquo; chimed in the
      inextinguishable Jimmy. &ldquo;I've got a cooking stove&mdash;for real fire&mdash;and
      blocks and a ball with a string.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Billy, who belonged to a club for the practice of the great American game,
      and was what A. Ward would call the most superior battest among the I. G.
      B. B. C, or &ldquo;Infant Giants,&rdquo; smiled from that altitude upon Jimmy, but
      promised to go and play with him the next Saturday afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that evening, after we had got home and dined, as I sat in my room
      over Pickwick, with a sedative cigar, a gentle knock at the door told of
      Daniel. I called &ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; and, entering with a slow dejected air, he sat
      down by my fire. For ten minutes he remained silent, though occasionally
      looking up as if about to speak, then dropping his head again to ponder on
      the coals. Finally I laid down Dickens, and spoke myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't seem well to-night, Daniel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't feel very well, uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, my boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah&mdash;I don't know. That is, I wish I knew how to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I studied him for a few moments with kindly curiosity, then answered:
      &ldquo;Perhaps I can save you the trouble by cross-examining it out of you.
      Let's try the method of elimination. I know that you are not harassed by
      any economical considerations, for you've all the money you want; and I
      know that ambition doesn't trouble you, for your tastes are scholarly.
      This narrows down the investigation of your symptoms&mdash;listlessness,
      general dejection, and all&mdash;to three causes: Dyspepsia, religious
      conflicts, love. Now is your digestion awry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, good as usual. I'm not melancholy on religion and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't tell me you're in love?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;yes&mdash;I suppose that's about it, Uncle Teddy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I took a long breath to recover from my astonishment at this unimaginable
      revelation, then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is your feeling returned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really don't know, uncle. I don't believe it is. I don't see how it can
      be. I never did anything to make her love me. What is there in me to love!
      I've borne enough for her&mdash;that is, nothing that could do her any
      good&mdash;though I've endured on her account, I may say, anguish. So,
      look at it any way you please, I neither am, do, nor suffer anything that
      can get a woman's love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you man of learning! Even in love you tote your grammar along with
      you, and arrange a divine passion under the active, passive, and neuter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daniel smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've no idea, Uncle Teddy, that you are twitting on facts; but you hit
      the truth there; indeed you do. If she were a Greek or Latin woman I could
      talk Anacreon or Horace to her. If women only understood the philosophy of
      the flowers as well as they do the poetry&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God they don't, Daniel!&rdquo; sighed out I devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind&mdash;in that case I could entrance her for hours, talking
      about the grounds of difference between Linnaeus and Jussieu. Women like
      the star business, they say&mdash;and I could tell her where all the
      constellations are; but sure as I tried to get off any sentiment about
      them, I'd break down and make myself ridiculous. But what earthly chance
      would the greatest philosopher that ever lived have with the woman he
      loved, if he depended for her favor on his ability to analyze her bouquet
      or tell her when she might look out for the next occultation of Orion? I
      can't talk bread and butter. I can't do anything that makes a man even
      tolerable to a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don't mean that nothing but bread and butter talk is tolerable
      to a woman!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; but it's necessary to some extent&mdash;at any rate the ability is&mdash;in
      order to succeed in society; and it is in society men first meet and
      strike women. And Uncle Teddy! I'm such a fish out of water in society!&mdash;such
      a dreadful floundering fish! When I see her dancing gracefully as a swan
      swims, and feel that fellows, like little Jack Mankyn, 'who don't know
      twelve times,' can dance to her perfect admiration; when I see that she
      likes ease of manners&mdash;and all sorts of men without an idea in their
      heads have that&mdash;while I turn all colors when I speak to her, and am
      clumsy; and abrupt, and abstracted, and bad at repartee&mdash;Uncle Teddy!
      sometimes (though it seems so ungrateful to father and mother, who have
      spent such pains for me)&mdash;sometimes, do you know, it seems to me as
      if I'd exchange all I've ever learned for the power to make a good
      appearance before her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Daniel, my boy, it's too much a matter of reflection with you! A woman is
      not to be taken by laying plans. If you love the lady (whose name I don't
      ask you because I know you'll tell me as soon as you think best), you must
      seek her companionship until you're well enough acquainted with her to
      have her regard you as something different from the men whom she meets
      merely in society, and judge your qualities by another standard than that
      she applies to them. If she's a sensible girl (and God forbid you should
      marry her otherwise!) she knows that people can't always be dancing, or
      holding fans, or running after orange ice. If she's a girl capable of
      appreciating your best points (and woe to you if you marry a girl who
      can't!), she'll find them out upon closer intimacy, and once found they'll
      a hundred times outweigh all brilliant advantages kept in the showcase of
      fellows who have nothing on the shelves. When this comes about, you will
      pop the question unconsciously, and, to adopt Milton, she will drop into
      your lap, 'gathered&mdash;not harshly plucked.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that's sensible, Uncle Teddy, and I'll try. Let me tell you the
      sacredest of secrets&mdash;regularly every day of my life I send her a
      little poem fastened round the prettiest bouquet I can get at Hanfts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she know who sends them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She can't have any idea. The German boy that takes them knows not a word
      of English except her name and address. You'll forgive me, Uncle, for not
      mentioning her name yet? You see she may despise or hate me some day when
      she knows who it is that has paid her these attentions; and then I'd like
      to be able to feel that at least I've never hurt her by any absurd
      connection with myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you? Nonsense! The feeling does your heart infinite credit,
      though a little counsel with your head would show you that your only
      absurdity is self-depreciation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Daniel bade me good-night. As I put out my cigar and went to bed, my mind
      reverted to the dauntless little Hotspur who had spent the afternoon with
      me, and reversed his mother's wish, thinking: &ldquo;Oh, if Daniel were more
      like Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was always Billy's habit to come and sit with me while I smoked my
      after-breakfast cigar, but the next morning did not see him enter my room
      till St. George's hands pointed to a quarter of nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Billy Boy Blue, come blow your horn; what haystack have you been
      under till this time of day? We shan't have a minute to look over our
      spelling together, and I know a boy is going in for promotion next week.
      Have you had your breakfast and taken care of Crab?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, but I didn't feel like getting up this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No-o-o&mdash;it isn't that; but you'll laugh at me if I tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed, I won't, Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;his voice dropped to a whisper and he stole close to my side&mdash;&ldquo;I
      had such a nice dream about <i>her</i> just the last thing before the bell
      rang; and when I woke up I felt so queer&mdash;so kinder good and kinder
      bad&mdash;and I wanted to see her so much, that if I hadn't been a big
      boy, I believe I should have blubbered. I tried ever so much to go to
      sleep and see her again; but the more I tried the more I couldn't. After
      all, I had to get up without it, though I didn't want any breakfast, and
      only ate two buckwheat cakes, when I always eat six, you know, Uncle
      Teddy. Can you keep a secret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dear, so you couldn't get it out of me if you were to shake me
      upside down like a savings-bank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ain't you mean! That was when I was small I did that. I'll tell you
      the secret, though&mdash;that girl and I are going to get married. I mean
      to ask her the first chance I get. Oh, isn't she a smasher!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Billy, shan't you wait a little while to see if you always like
      her as well as you do now? Then, too, you'll be older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm old enough, Uncle Teddy, and I love her dearly. I am as old as the
      Kings of France used to be when they got married&mdash;I read it in
      Abbott's history. But there's the clock striking nine! I must run or I
      shall get a tardy mark and perhaps she'll want to see my certificate some
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he kissed me on the cheek and set off for school as fast as his
      legs could carry him. Oh, Love, omnivorous Love, that sparest neither the
      dotard leaning on his staff nor the boy with pantaloons buttoning on his
      jacket&mdash;omnipotent Love, that, after parents and teachers have
      failed, in one instant can make Billy try to become a good boy!
    </p>
    <p>
      With both of my nephews hopelessly enamored and myself the confidant of
      both, I had my hands full. Daniel was generally dejected and distrustful;
      Billy buoyant and jolly. Daniel found it impossible to overcome his
      bashfulness, was spontaneous only in sonnets, brilliant only in bouquets.
      Billy was always coming to me with pleasant news, told in his slangy New
      York boy vernacular. One day he would exclaim: &ldquo;Oh, I'm getting on prime!
      I got such a smile off her this morning as I went by the window!&rdquo; Another
      day he wanted counsel how to get a valentine to her&mdash;because it was
      too big to shove in a lamppost and she might catch him if he left it on
      the steps, rang the bell, and ran away. Daniel wrote his own valentine,
      but, despite its originality, that document gave him no such comfort as
      Billy got from twenty-five cents' worth of embossed paper, pink cupids,
      and doggerel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally Billy announced to me that he had been to play with Jimmy and got
      introduced to his girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this Lu gave what they call &ldquo;a little company&rdquo;&mdash;not a
      party, but a reunion of forty or fifty people with whom the family were
      well acquainted, several of them living in our immediate neighborhood.
      There was a goodly proportion of young fold and there was to be dancing;
      but the music was limited to a single piano played by the German exile
      usual on such occasions, and the refreshments did not rise to the splendor
      of a costly supper. This kind of compromise with fashionable gayety was
      wisely deemed by Lu the best method of introducing Daniel to the <i>beau
      monde</i>&mdash;a push given the timid eaglet by the maternal bird, with a
      soft tree-top between him and the vast expanse of society. How simple was
      the entertainment may be inferred from the fact that Lu felt somewhat
      discomposed when she got a note from one of her guests asking leave to
      bring along her niece who was making her a few weeks' visit. As a matter
      of course, however, she returned answer to bring the young lady and
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel's dressing-room having been given up to the gentlemen, I invited
      him to make his toilet in mine, and indeed, wanting him to create a
      favorable impression, became his valet <i>pro tem</i>., tying his cravat
      and teasing the divinity-student look out of his side hair. My little
      dandy Billy came in for another share of attention, and when I managed to
      button his jacket for him so that it showed his shirt studs &ldquo;like a
      man's,&rdquo; Count d'Orsay could not have felt a greater sense of his
      sufficiency for all the demands of the gay world.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we reached the parlor we found Pa and Ma Lovegrove already receiving.
      About a score of guests had arrived. Most of them were old married couples
      which, after paying their devoirs, fell in two like unriveted scissors,
      the gentlemen finding a new pivot in pa and the ladies in ma, where they
      mildly opened and shut upon such questions as severally concerned them,
      such as &ldquo;The way gold closed&rdquo; and &ldquo;How the children were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Besides the old married people there were several old young men, of
      distinctly hopeless and unmarried aspect, who, having nothing in common
      with the other class, nor sufficient energy of character to band
      themselves for mutual protection, hovered dejectedly about the arch
      pillars or appeared to be considering whether on the whole it would not be
      feasible and best to sit down on the centre-table. These subsisted upon
      such crumbs of comfort as Lu could get an occasional chance to throw them
      by rapid sorties of conversation&mdash;became galvanically active the
      moment they were punched up and fell flat the moment the punching was
      remitted. I did all I could for them, but, having Daniel in tow, dared not
      sail too near the edge of the Doldrums, lest he should drop into
      sympathetic stagnation and be taken preternaturally bashful with his sails
      all aback, just as I wanted to carry him gallantly into action with some
      clipper-built cruiser of a nice young lady. Finally, Lu bethought herself
      of that last plank of drowning conversationalists, the photograph album.
      All the dejected young men made for it at once, some reaching it just as
      they were about to sink for the last time, but all getting a grip on it
      somehow and staying there, in company with other people's babies whom they
      didn't know, and celebrities whom they knew to death, until, one by one,
      they either stranded upon a motherly dowager by the Fire-Place Shoals, or
      were rescued from the Sofa Reef by some gallant wrecker of a strong-minded
      young lady, with a view of taking salvage out of them in the German.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides these, were already arrived a dozen nice little boys and girls who
      had been invited to make it pleasant for Billy. I had to remind him of the
      fact that they were his guests, for, in comparison with the queen of his
      affections, they were in danger of being despised by him as small fry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger ladies and gentlemen&mdash;those who had fascinations to
      disport or were in the habit of disporting what they considered such&mdash;were
      probably still at home consulting the looking-glass until that oracle
      should announce the auspicious moment for their setting forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel was in conversation with a perfect godsend of a girl who understood
      Latin and had taken up Greek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was taking a moment's vacation from his boys and girls, busy with
      &ldquo;Old Maid&rdquo; in the extension room, and whispering, with his hand in mine,
      &ldquo;Oh, don't I wish <i>she</i> were here!&rdquo; when a fresh invoice of ladies,
      just unpacked from the dressing-room, in all the airy elegance of evening
      costume, floated through the door. I heard Lu say:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Mrs. Rumbullion! happy to see your niece, too. How do you do, Miss
      Pilgrim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this last word Billy jumped as if he had been shot, and the bevy of
      ladies opening about Sister Lu disclosed the charming face and figure of
      the pretty girl we had met at Barnum's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's countenance rapidly changed from astonishment to joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that splendid, Uncle Teddy? Just as I was wishing it! It's just
      like the fairy books!&rdquo; and, rushing up to the party of new-comers, &ldquo;My
      dear Lottie!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;if I had only known you were coming I'd have come
      after you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he caught her by the hand, I was pleased to see her soft eyes brighten
      with gratification at his enthusiasm, but my sister Lu looked on,
      naturally with astonishment in every feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why Billy!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you ought not to call a strange young lady '<i>Lottie?</i>
      Miss Pilgrim, you must excuse my wild boy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you must excuse my mother, Lottie,&rdquo; said Billy, affectionately
      patting Miss Pilgrim's rose kid, &ldquo;for calling you a strange young lady.
      You are not strange at all&mdash;you're just as nice a girl as there is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are no excuses necessary,&rdquo; said Miss Pilgrim, with a bewitching
      little laugh. &ldquo;Billy and I know each other intimately well, Mrs.
      Lovegrove, and I confess that when I heard the lady Aunt had been invited
      to visit was his mother, I felt all the more willing to infringe on
      etiquette this evening, by coming where I had no previous introduction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you care!&rdquo; said Billy encouragingly, &ldquo;I'll introduce you to every
      one of our family; I know 'em if you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment I came up as Billy's reinforcement, and, fearing lest, in
      his enthusiasm, he might forget the canon of society which introduced a
      gentleman to a lady, not a lady to him, I ventured to suggest it
      delicately by saying, &ldquo;Billy, will you grant me the favor of a
      presentation to Miss Pilgrim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a minute, Uncle Teddy,&rdquo; answered Billy, considerably lowering his
      voice. &ldquo;The older people first;&rdquo; and after this reproof I was left to wait
      in the cold until he had gone through the ceremony of introducing to the
      young lady his father and his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, who had now assumed entire guardianship of Miss Pilgrim, with an
      air of great dignity intrusted her to my care, and left us promenading
      while he went in search of Daniel. I, myself, looked in vain for that
      youth, whom I had not seen since the entrance of the last comers. Miss
      Pilgrim and I found a congenial common ground in Billy, whom she spoke of
      as one of the most delightfully original boys she had ever met; in fact,
      altogether the most fascinating young gentleman she had seen in New York
      society. You may be sure it wasn't Billy's left ear which burned when I
      made my responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      In five minutes he reappeared to announce, in a tone of disappointment,
      that he could find Daniel nowhere. He could see a light through his
      keyhole, but the door was locked and he could get no admittance. Just then
      Lu came up to present a certain&mdash;no, an uncertain&mdash;young man of
      the fleet stranded on parlor furniture earlier in the evening. To Lu's
      great astonishment, Miss Pilgrim asked Billy's permission to leave him. It
      was granted with all the courtesy of a <i>preux chevalier</i>, on the
      condition, readily assented to, that she should dance one Lancers with him
      during the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; exclaimed Lu, after Billy had gone back like a superior being,
      to assist at the childish amusement of his contemporaries, &ldquo;would anybody
      ever suppose that was our Billy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should, my dear sister,&rdquo; said I, with proud satisfaction; &ldquo;but you
      remember I always was just to Billy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Left free, I went myself to hunt up Daniel. I found his door locked and a
      light showing through the keyhole, as Billy had said. I made no attempt to
      enter by knocking; but, going to my room and opening the window next his,
      I leaned out as far as I could, shoved up his sash with my cane and pushed
      aside his curtain. Such an unusual method of communication could not fail
      to bring him to the window with a rush. When he saw me, he trembled like a
      guilty thing, his countenance fell, and, no longer able to feign absence,
      he unlocked his door and let me enter by the normal mode.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Daniel Lovegrove, my nephew, what does this mean; are you sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Uncle Edward, I am not sick, and this means that I am a fool. Even a
      little boy like Billy puts me to shame. I feel humbled to the very dust. I
      wish I'd been a missionary and got massacred by savages. Oh, that I'd been
      permitted to wear damp stockings in childhood, or that my mother hadn't
      carried me through the measles! If it weren't wrong to take my life into
      my own hands, I'd open that window and&mdash;and&mdash;sit in a draught
      this very evening! Oh, yes! I'm just that bitter! Oh! Oh! Oh!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Daniel paced the floor with strides of frenzy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my dear fellow, let's look at the matter calmly for a minute. What
      brought on this sudden attack? You seemed doing well enough the first ten
      minutes after we came down. I was only out of your sight long enough to
      speak to the Rumbullion party who had just come in, and when I turned you
      were gone. Now you are in this fearful condition. What is there in the
      Rumbullions to start you off on such a bender of bash-fulness as this
      which I here behold?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rumbullions indeed!&rdquo; said Daniel. &ldquo;A hundred Rumbillions could not make
      me feel as I do; but <i>she</i> can shake me into a whirlwind with her
      little finger, and <i>she</i> came with the Rumbullions!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! D'you&mdash;Miss Pilgrim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Pilgrim!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I labored with Daniel for ten minutes, using every encouragement and
      argument I could think of, and finally threatened him that I would bring
      up the whole Rumbullion party, Miss Pilgrim included, telling them that he
      invited them to look at his conchological cabinet, unless he instantly
      shook the ice out of his manner and accompanied me downstairs. This
      dreadful menace had the desired effect. He knew that I would not scruple
      to fulfil it; and at the same time that it made him surrender it also
      provoked him with me to a degree which gave his eyes and cheeks as fine a
      glow as I could have wished for the purpose of a favorable impression. The
      stimulus of wrath was good for him, and there was little tremor in his
      knees when he descended the stairs. Well-a-day&mdash;so Daniel and Billy
      were rivals!
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter gentleman met us at the foot of the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there you are, Daniel!&rdquo; said he, cheerily. &ldquo;I was just going to look
      for you and Uncle Teddy. We wanted you for the dances. We have had the
      Lancers twice and three round dances; and I danced the second Lancers with
      Lottie. Now we're going to play some games to amuse the children, you
      know,&rdquo; he added loftily with the adult gesture of pointing his thumb over
      his shoulder at the extension room. &ldquo;Lottie's going to play, too, so will
      you and Daniel, won't you, uncle? Oh, here comes Lottie now! This is my
      brother, Miss Pilgrim; let me introduce him to you. I'm sure you'll like
      him. There's nothing he don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pilgrim had just come to the newel post of the staircase, and when
      she looked into Daniel's face blushed like the red, red rose, losing her
      self-possession perceptibly more than Daniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courage of weak warriors and timid gallants mounts as the opposite
      party's falls, and Daniel made out to say, in a firm tone, that it was
      long since he had enjoyed the pleasure of meeting Miss Pilgrim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not since Mrs. Cramcroud's last sociable, I think,&rdquo; replied Miss Pilgrim,
      her cheeks and eyes still playing the telltale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oho! so you don't want any introduction,&rdquo; exclaimed Master Billy. I
      didn't know you knew each other, Lottie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have met Mr. Lovegrove in society. Shall we go and join in the plays?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure we shall!&rdquo; cried Billy. &ldquo;You needn't mind; all the grown
      people are going to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On entering the parlor we found it as he had said. The guests being almost
      all well acquainted with each other, at the solicitation of jolly little
      Mrs. Bloomingal, Sister Lu had consented to make a pleasant Christmas kind
      of time of it, in which everybody was permitted to be young again and romp
      with the rompiest. We played Blindman's-buff till we tired of that&mdash;Daniel,
      to Lu's great delight, coming out splendidly as Blindman, and evincing
      such &ldquo;cheek&rdquo; in the style he hunted down and caught the ladies, as
      satisfied me that nothing but his sight stood in the way of his making an
      audacious figure in the world. Then a pretty little girl, Tilly Turtelle,
      who seemed quite a premature flirt, proposed &ldquo;Doorkeeper&rdquo;&mdash;a
      suggestion accepted with great <i>éclat</i> by all the children, several
      grown people assenting.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Billy&mdash;quite as much on account of his shining prominence in the
      executive faculties of his character, as host&mdash;was committed the duty
      of counting out the first person to be sent into the hall. There were so
      many of us that &ldquo;Aina-maina-mona-mike&rdquo; would not go quite around; but with
      that promptness of expedient which belongs to genius, Billy instantly
      added on &ldquo;Intery-mintery-cutery-corn,&rdquo; and the last word of the cabalistic
      formula fell upon me, Edward Balbus. I disappeared into the entry amid
      peals of happy laughter from both old and young, calling, when the door
      opened again to ask me who I wanted, for the pretty, lisping flirt who had
      proposed the game. After giving me a coquettish little chirrup of a kiss
      and telling me my beard scratched, she bade me, on my return, send out to
      her &ldquo;Mither Billy Lovegrove.&rdquo; I obeyed her; my youngest nephew retired
      and, after a couple of seconds, during which Tilly undoubtedly got what
      she proposed the game for, Billy being a great favorite with the little
      girls, she came back pouting and blushing, to announce that he wanted Miss
      Pilgrim. The young lady showed no mock modesty, but arose at once and
      laughingly went out to her youthful admirer, who, as I afterward learned,
      embraced her ardently and told her he loved her better than any girl in
      the world. As he turned to go back she told him that he might send to her
      one of her juvenile cousins, Reginald Rumbullion. Now, whether because on
      this youthful Rumbullion's account Billy had suffered the pangs of that
      most terrible passion, jealousy, or from his natural enjoyment of playing
      practical jokes destructive of all dignity in his elders, Billy marched
      into the room, and, having shut the door behind him, paralyzed the crowded
      parlor by an announcement that Mr. Daniel Lovegrove was wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was standing at his side and could feel him' tremble&mdash;see him turn
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he whispered, in a choking voice; &ldquo;can she mean me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course she does,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;Who else? Do you hesitate? Surely you can't
      refuse such an invitation from a lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I suppose not,&rdquo; said he, mechanically. And, amid much laughter from
      the disinterested, while the faces of Mrs. Rumbullion and his mother were
      spectacles of crimson astonishment, he made his exit from the room. Never
      in my life did I so much long for that instrument, described by Mr. Samuel
      Weller&mdash;a pair of patent, double-million magnifying microscopes of
      hex-tery power, to see through a deal door. Instead of this I had to learn
      what happened only by report.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lottie Pilgrim was standing under the hall burners with her elbow on the
      newel-post, more vividly charming than he had ever seen her before, at
      Mrs. Crajncroud's sociable or elsewhere. When startled by the apparition
      of Mr. Daniel Lovegrove instead of little Rumbullion whom she was
      expecting&mdash;she had no time to exclaim or hide her mounting color,
      none at all to explain to her own mind the mistake that had occurred,
      before his arm was clasped around her waist and his lips so closely
      pressed to hers that, through her soft, thick hair she could feel the
      throbbing of his temples. As for Daniel, he seemed in a walking dream,
      from which he waked to see Miss Pilgrim looking into his eyes with utter,
      though not incensed stupefaction,&mdash;to stammer, &ldquo;Forgive me! do
      forgive me! I thought you were in, earnest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was,&rdquo; she said tremulously, as soon as she could catch her voice,
      &ldquo;in sending for my cousin Reginald.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, what shall I do! Believe me, I was told you wanted me. Let me go
      and explain it to mother. She will tell the rest&mdash;I couldn't do it&mdash;I'd
      die of mortification. Oh, that wretched boy Billy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the principle already mentioned, his agitation reassured her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't try to explain it now&mdash;it may get Billy a scolding. Are there
      any but intimate family friends here this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I believe&mdash;no&mdash;I'm sure,&rdquo; replied Daniel, collecting
      his faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I don't mind what they think. Perhaps they'll suppose we've known
      each other long; but we'll arrange it by and by. They'll think the more of
      it the longer we stay out here&mdash;hear them laugh! I must run back now.
      I'll send you somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A round of juvenile applause greeted her as she hurried into the parlor,
      and a number of grown people smiled quite musically. Her quick woman's wit
      told her how to retaliate and divide the embarrassment of the occasion. As
      she passed me she said in an undertone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Answer quick! Who is that fat lady on the sofa who laughed so loud?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Cromwell Craggs,&rdquo; said I, quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pilgrim made a satirically low courtesy and spoke in a modest but
      distinct voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really must be excused for asking. I'm a stranger, you know; but is
      there such a lady here as Mrs. Craggs&mdash;Mrs. <i>Cromwell</i> Craggs?
      For, if so, the present doorkeeper would like to see Mrs. Cromwell
      Craggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then came the turn of the fat lady to be laughed at; but out she had to go
      and get kissed like the rest of us. Before the close of the evening Billy
      was made as jealous as his parents and I were surprised to see Daniel in
      close conversation with Miss Pilgrim among the geraniums and fuchsias of
      the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A regular flirtation,&rdquo; said Billy, somewhat indignantly. The conclusion
      which they arrived at was that after all no great harm had been done, and
      that the dear little fellow ought not to be peached on for his fun. If I
      had known at the time how easily they forgave him, I should have suspected
      that the offence Billy had led Daniel into committing was not unlikely to
      be repeated on the offender's own account; but so much as I could see
      showed me that the ice was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy's jealousy did not outlast the party. He became more and more
      interested in &ldquo;his girl,&rdquo; and often went in the afternoon, after getting
      out of school, ostensibly to play with Jimmy. Daniel's calls, according to
      adult etiquette, made in the evening, did not interfere with my younger
      nephew's, and as neither knew that the other, after his fashion, was his
      most uncompromising rival, my position, as the confidant of both, was one
      of extreme delicacy. But the matter was more speedily settled than I
      expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy came to me one day and told me that he intended to get married
      immediately; that he was going to speak to his Lottie that very afternoon.
      He was prepared to meet every objection. He had asked his father if he
      might, and his father said yes, if he had money enough to support a wife&mdash;and
      Billy thought he had. He'd saved up all the money his Uncle Jim and Aunt
      Jane had sent him for Christmas; and besides, if he were once married, his
      father wouldn't see him want for stamps, he knew. Then, too, he was going
      to leave school and be a merchant next year&mdash;and I'd help him now and
      then, if he got hard up, wouldn't I? If he were driven to it, he could be
      a good boy again, and save up the money to buy Lottie presents with,
      instead of giving it to nasty old &ldquo;Objecks.&rdquo; He was so much older than
      when he had the savings-bank that he ought to have at least ten cents a
      day now for being good; didn't I think that was fair? As to his age, if
      Lottie loved him, he didn't care&mdash;anyway he would be lots bigger than
      she was before long&mdash;and he'd often heard his ma say she approved of
      early marriages; hers and pa's was one. So he ran off up Livingston Place,
      the most undaunted lover that ever put an extra shine on his proposal
      boots, or spent half an hour on the bow of his popping necktie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after, Daniel went into the street. Not meaning to call upon his
      <i>inamorata</i>, but drawn by the irresistible fascination of passing her
      house, he strolled in the direction that Billy had gone. As he came to the
      Rumbullions', something suddenly bade him enter&mdash;a whim he called it,
      but not his own&mdash;one of the whims of destiny which are always
      gratified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;Miss Pilgrim is in, I will call her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His step was always light. He passed noiselessly into the front parlor and
      sat down among the heavy brocatelle curtains which shadowed the recess of
      one of the windows. He supposed Miss Pilgrim to be upstairs, and while his
      heart fluttered, expecting her footfall at the particular door, he heard
      an earnest boyish voice in the inside room. Looking from his concealment
      he beheld Miss Pilgrim on a sofa in the pier and sitting by her side, with
      her hand clasped in his, his brother Billy. Before he could avoid it, he
      became aware that Billy was unconsciously but eagerly forestalling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Lottie, my dear Lottie! I wish you would! I'll do everything I can
      to make you happy. If you'll only marry me, I'll be good all the time!
      Come now! Say yes! Father's got a really nice place over the stable&mdash;they
      only use it for a tool room now; we could clear it out and have it
      scrubbed and go to housekeeping right away. Ma'd let us have all her old
      set of chinai I've got a silver mug Uncle Teddy gave me and a napkin ring
      and four spoons. As soon as I make my money I'll buy a nice carriage and
      horses, any color you want 'em. Oh, my darling, darling Lottie, I do love
      you so much and we could have such a splendid time! Do say yes, Lottie&mdash;please,
      <i>do</i> please!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pilgrim looked at the earnest little suitor with a face in which
      tender interest and compassion quite overrode any sense of the
      whimsicality of the situation which might lurk there. Daniel's
      astonishment at the sight was so great that he realized the entire state
      of the case before he could recover himself sufficiently to rise and go
      into the back room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy jumped up and looked defiantly at the intruder. Miss Pilgrim blushed
      violently, but turned away her head to avoid the exhibition of a still
      more convulsing emotion than embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must beg your pardon, Miss Pilgrim&mdash;and yours, too, Billy,&rdquo; began
      Daniel in a hesitating way, hardly knowing how to treat the posture in
      which he found things, &ldquo;but&mdash;you see&mdash;the fact is the servant
      said she'd go to announce me&mdash;and really when I came in, I hadn't any
      idea you were here, or Billy either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Billy, moderating the defiant attitude, &ldquo;you actually weren't
      dodging around and trying to find out what Lottie and I were about on the
      sly? Well, I'll believe you. I'm sure you couldn't be as mean as that,
      when I'm the only brother you have got, that always brings you oranges
      when you're sick, and never plays ball on the stairs when you've got a
      headache. Now, then, I'll trust you, I've been asking Lottie to marry me,
      and I want you to help me. Ask her if she won't, Daniel&mdash;see if she
      won't do it for you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Pilgrim had been trying to find words, but her face was too much for
      her and she was obliged to seek retirement in her handkerchief. As she
      drew it from her pocket, a well-worn piece of paper followed it and fell
      upon the floor. Billy picked it up before she noticed it, and was about to
      hand it to her, when his jealous eye fell upon a withered rosebud sewed to
      its margin. As he looked at it, with his little brows knit into a
      precocious sternness, he recognized his brother's handwriting immediately
      beneath the flower. It was one of the daily anonymous sonnets, of which
      Daniel had told me, and the bud a relic of the bouquet accompanying it.
      Still Daniel was silent. What else could he be?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, very well, Master Daniel!&rdquo; exclaimed Billy, in a voice
      trembling with grief and indignation, &ldquo;there's good enough reason why you
      won't speak a word for me. You want her yourself&mdash;here it is in your
      own writing. No wonder you won't tell Lottie to be my wife, when you're
      trying to take her away from me. Oh, Lottie, dear Lottie! I love you just
      as much as he does, though I don't know everything and can't write you
      poetry like it was out of the Fifth Reader! Daniel, how could you go and
      write to my Lottie this way: 'My churner'&mdash;no, it isn't churner, it's
      charmer,&mdash;'let me call thee mine'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Forgetting the sacredness of private MS. in that of private grief, he
      would have gone on, with a pause here and there for certainty of spelling,
      to the conclusion of the poem, had not Lottie sprung up, with her
      imploring face suffused by her discovery, for the first time, of the
      identity of her secret lover and the escape of his sonnet from her pocket.
      It was too late! There he stood before her unmistakably proved, and
      herself unmistakably proving in what estimation she held his verses and
      bouquets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh Billy, dear Billy! If you do love me, don't do so!&rdquo; So exclaiming, she
      held out her hand, and Billy put the MS. into it with all the dignity of a
      wounded spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lovegrove,&rdquo; said Miss Pilgrim, &ldquo;I don't know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel very much that way myself,&rdquo; said Daniel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> don't,&rdquo; said Billy, now in command of his voice. &ldquo;I'll tell you
      what it is: perhaps Daniel didn't know how much I wanted you, Lottie&mdash;and
      perhaps he wants you 'most as bad as I do. But whatever way it is, I want
      you to choose between us, fair and square, and no dodging. Come now! You
      can take just whichever one of us you please, and the other won't lay up
      any grudge, though I know if that's me, or like me, he'll feel awful. You
      can have till to-morrow morning to make up your mind between me and
      Daniel, and if he won't say anything about it to pa and ma till then, I
      won't. Good-by, <i>dear</i> Lottie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her face down to his, kissed her almost affectionately and then
      marched out of the door, feeling, as he afterward told me, as if he had
      blackened his boots all for nothing. Ah me! my dear Billy, how many times
      we do that in this world! Of what followed when Daniel and Miss Pilgrim
      were left alone, I have never had full details.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I do know that the young lady obeyed Billy and made her choice. Six
      months after that both my nephews stood up in Mrs. Rumbullion's parlor to
      take their several shares in a ceremony in which Miss Pilgrim was the
      central figure when it began, and Mrs. Daniel Lovegrove when it concluded.
      Time and elasticity of boyhood had so closed the sharp but evanescent
      wound in Billy's heart that he could stand the trial of being groomsman
      where he had wanted to be groom&mdash;more especially since he was
      supported through the emergency by a little sister of Lottie's who
      promised to be wondrously like her by the time Billy could stand up in the
      more enviable capacity. Neither Daniel nor Lottie would listen to any
      objection to such a groomsman on the score of his extreme youth, for, as
      they said, Billy had been quite as instrumental in bringing them together
      as any agent, save the Divinity shaping the ends and tying all the knots
      in which there are heartstrings concerned, as well as white ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then Lu has stopped wishing that Billy were like Daniel, for she
      says that if he had been, there would never have been any Mrs. Daniel
      Lovegrove in the world.
